### My Professional Life

Hello, my name is Vincent and I am a student who consider myself to be a data scientist, designer, and developer. My work as well as my interest falls into learning about new technology and programming. While my hobbies include cooking, performing data analysis, and creating art. My website <a href = "http://www.vincentylee.com/">vincentylee.com</a> is a portfolio that includes all my works and achievements throughout the years. While <a href = "http://www.sketchplatform.com/">sketchplatform.com</a> is created with the intent for sharing creative and innovative ideas alongside the community.


### My Personal Life

- I'm not saying that I am a chef or anything, but I find food incredibily sexy and innovative. If you ever come over try my sweet "Panna Cotta" for dessert.

- I love videogames and fitness trackers. I'm obsessed with any IoT device that tracks or gamifies my performance. One day I would like to make my own Mobile or VR game that incentivizes movement.

- I find myself spending most weekends playing board games, painting, or exploring new restuarants with my friends. 

- Before my accident, I was an experienced martial artist in Tae-kwon-do (kickboxing). I no longer participate in the sport, but I still incorporate its techniques in my workout regiments.

- Currently, I'm trying to learn plate spinning.
