## Websites

- **[ugrid.info](http://ugrid.info)** - A website that created for my undergraduate data science organization. It's a website used for sharing data science analysis, announcements, and tutorials. 

- **[stuckonfish.com](http://www.stuckonfish.com)** - An ecommerce website made using wordpress. Currently, the website is not being used by the client. It was a great lesson for purchasing adwords, implementing google analytics, and building an online store.

- **[sketchplatform.com](http://www.sketchplatform.com)** - My personal website created with the intent for sharing innovation and design. It was practice to create a completely full stack application with encrypted login & password, upload & download, and lastly a database for storage. Honestly, this was an art gallery that is no longer active.

- **[vincentyl.com](http://www.vincentyl.com/)** - A central hub that is use to showcase my portfolio (you're currently on it!).

## Data Analysis

- **[Human Resource Data Analysis](http://www.vincentyl.com/2017-03-11-HR_dataset/)** - A basic tutorial analysis on the human resource dataset using decision trees and random forests

- **[Chernoff Faces](http://www.vincentyl.com/projects/ChernoffFaces)** - Characterized facial recoginition visual. This is a test for uploading different filetypes on by website.

## Visuals

- **[Tableau Portfolio](https://public.tableau.com/profile/vincent6778)** - A tableau portfolio used for data visualization. I spend 30 minutes every week to practice my skills in [makeovermonday](http://www.makeovermonday.co.uk). You can see how my visuals have gotten better overtime with minimal time spent.

- **[Art Gallery](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0B7qRQkZ2lu7Tc2RsMnRMTVZZQ00?usp=sharing)** - My personal art gallery, most of these artworks are logos and designs requested by friends or business acquaintance.

## Programming Projects

- **[Mobile Health Sensing App](http://www.vincentyl.com/projects/mobile_health)** - An android app that involves the integration of step detection, activity recognition, text-to-speech, and heart rate monitoring.

- **[Paca Pace](http://www.vincentyl.com/projects/paca_pace)** - An android app that involves the integration of RPM detection for cycling cadence. This is a personal project that I made with a partner, we took inspiration from the mobile health sensing app.

## Honors
